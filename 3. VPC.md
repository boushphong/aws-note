# NAT Gateway
- A NAT Gateway is a highly available AWS-managed service that enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, while preventing the internet from initiating connections with those instances. It does this by translating the private IP addresses of the instances into a public IP address.
- Responsible for giving instances that are in a private `subnet` (a partition of a `VPC network` that's seperated from others, some subnets don't have internet access)

# Internet Gateway

- `Internet Gateway` (IGW) is a component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.
- You can think of an Internet Gateway as a `Modem`, A `Modem` is used to connect to the internet (One might use a modem indirectly through a `Router` or indirectly through a network (Eg. University Network ...)

# Internet Gateway enables:
- Inbound and outbound access to the internet.
- Performs network address translation (NAT) for public instances.
- Horizontally scaled, Redundant & Highly Available

**NOTE:** 
- Internet Gateway is a software component
- 1 VPC needs 1 Internet Gateway to enable internet access. (1-to-1 Mapping). You attach an `Internet Gateway` to a `VPC`, that how a `VPC` is granted Internet Access. (An `Intenet Gateway` can't be attached to more than 1 `VPC` at a time, and a `VPC` can't have more than one `Internet Gateway` at a time)
- Different than `NAT Gateway`

- `Route tables` in AWS are used to determine where network traffic is directed within a `VPC`. An `Internet Gateway` is used to allow traffic to flow between a `VPC` and the internet. To enable traffic to flow between resources in a VPC and the internet, a route is added to the `VPC's route table` that directs traffic with a destination of 0.0.0.0/0 to the internet gateway. This tells the `VPC` to send any traffic with a destination outside of the `VPC` to the internet gateway, which then handles the traffic's routing to the correct destination.

- From the picture, in the IP space (CIDR Range of the VPC) `10.0.0.0/16`, we allow `local` communications within the space is allowed, and since the public subset `10.0.0.0/24` and private subnet `10.0.1.0/24` is within the `VPC's IP Space`, instances to instances communications between the two subnet is allowed freely, in other words, communication is routed locally (Any communication to the destination within the `VPC's IP space` is routed `locally`).

- The the destination of `0.0.0.0/0`, which means all IP destinations on the internet, in this case, instances within the public subnet cannot directly make communications directly to the internet. The communications will be routed first to the `Internet Gateway`.

- For the private subnet's instances to be able to connect to the internet (Which rarely, maybe in the case of updating softwares ...), A `NAT Gateway` is needed for such communication. The `NAT Gateway` will be have to be resided in the Public Subnet and it will communicate with the `Internet Gateway`. The flow would be as following (Private Subnet Instanace > NAT Gateway in the Public Subnet > Internet Gateway) and then back.
