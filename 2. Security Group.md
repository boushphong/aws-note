# Security Group
- Virtual Firewall for your EC2 instances
- Blocks all traffic except the ports, protocols, and sources you specify
- Rules are defined as Inbound and Outbound
- Rules are stateful (Any traffic that is allowed to enter the instance is automatically allowed to leave, regardless of outbound rules.)
- Allows for very fine grain access controls

# How it works

Security Group can be thought of a Firewall, which some routers or modem have its owned hardware-based implementation, it can also be available on individual computer (eg. Windows Firewall).

- Security Group can be applied at the instance level (Fine-grained control)

Example Security Group:

- The first row (Rule) means the instances within the `Security Group` could only receive traffics of other EC2 instances that are members of the `sg-089c7bca6f59f2dd6` Security Group to the port 3306.
- The seconds row (Rule) means the instances within the `Security Group` could receive incoming HTTPS traffic on port 443 from the internet (The internet could communicate with the instance through port 443 of the instances)
